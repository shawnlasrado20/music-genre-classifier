Music Genre Classifier
Project Overview
This project involves the classification of music genres using machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on a dataset containing various audio features, and it predicts the genre of a given audio clip based on its characteristics.

Features
Data: The model uses a dataset containing audio features (like spectral centroid, MFCC, etc.) extracted from 30-second audio clips.

Machine Learning Model: The classifier is built using algorithms like Random Forest or any other classifier that performs well on the dataset.

Genres: The model classifies music into genres such as Blues, Classical, Jazz, Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, etc.

Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Scikit-learn (for model building)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

Google Colab (for cloud-based execution)

Dataset
The dataset consists of audio features extracted from music files. Features include chroma_stft, spectral centroid, spectral bandwidth, MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), and more.

Genres: The dataset includes multiple genres, such as Blues, Classical, Jazz, Rock, etc.

Getting Started
To run the project locally or in a cloud-based environment like Google Colab:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/music-genre-classifier.git
cd music-genre-classifier
Install dependencies: If you have Python installed, you can install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code: Open the notebook (Music Genre Classifier.ipynb) and run the cells to train and evaluate the model.

Model Performance
Accuracy: 76% (adjust based on your actual results)

Precision, Recall, F1-Score: The model's performance varies for different genres. Detailed metrics are provided in the notebook.

How to Use
Train the Model: The model can be trained using the provided dataset, which is already pre-processed in the notebook.

Predict Music Genre: Once trained, you can input a new music file (with similar features) and get the predicted genre.
